Today's websites are dynamic. Websites are no longer static 'webpages', instead functioning virtually as 'web apps'. This track is aimed at teaching how to build dynamic websites with Javascript and with Flask, a dead simple Python microframework. Following this track, one will learn how to structure pages with HTML and CSS, how to program in Javascript and Python, how to design and query databases with SQL, how to deploy on services such as Github Pages and Heroku, and how to use Ajax with JSON. As Devcamp's first and quintessential track, this track will also discuss different tools (such as Git) and methodologies. This track is designed for students with or without prior web development experience.
